                <h2>Overview:</h2>
                <p>In the beginning, we needed to think about some problems we came across in day-to-day life. We noticed how many
                    plastic
                    bags we are still using, although criticism. After the research, we found out, that encouragement to use reusable
                    bags
                    may not be the solution, as they make similar harm to the environment. So we dig deeper into this research area, to
                    discover, that many people have problems with waste segregation. Then we talk to many people, giving insights about
                    their perspective. Those interviews made us look at the bigger picture, which is the amount of generated waste.</p>
                <p>A long process of thinking about problems and the potential solutions resulted in a high-fidelity prototype of an
                    app,
                    that helps to lead a zero-waste lifestyle. This app would highlight eco-friendly shops, cafeterias, and places to
                    share
                    and exchange some items.</p>

            <h2 class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s" >The problem</h2>
            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">The problem we were first thinking of was about disposable plastic bags. However, our research was kind of unexpected, as we found out that it isn't such a big problem right now. Moreover, reusable bags won't solve this problem, as they require a lot of resources to be produced. As a result, they need to be used for a long time to be more eco-friendly, than disposable plastic bags.</p>
            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">As we were researching plastic bags, we found out that many people have problems with waste segregation. It causes
            multiple problems, such as difficulties with recycling. To better understand the reasons that cause those problems, we
            decided to arrange qualitative interviews.</p>
        </section>


        <section>
            <h2 class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">Qualitative interviews</h2>
            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">We conducted eighteen interviews in total. At the first ten interviews, we asked representative and diverse group of
            people more general questions about the environment and waste management. We also reached out to the founder and
            activist of the largest zero-waste group on Facebook in Poland. He gave us a lot of insights into the current situation
            in Europe and Poland. After those interviews, we have done another eight, with different people, where we asked more
            specific questions about the most interesting topics that came out earlier.</p>
            <h4 class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">Results:</h4>
            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">We found out, that the main motivations of carrying about the environment are the sense of pride and the need of taking
            care of friends and family. The things that discourage from reduction and segregation of waste are the inevitability of
            plastic usage, lack of space for segregation baskets, and the feeling that segregation is pointless, as other people are
            too lazy to do that. To encourage people to segregate, we should give them the feeling that segregation is beneficial,
            they could save money via segregation and show them it is easy to do.</p>
            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">The interviews showed us a strong relation between waste segregation and waste reduction. With growing awareness of the
            need to limit waste, people would also be paying more attention to segregation, as it would make recycling easier.
            That's why we started to look at both of these areas as the same problem.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2 class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">Empathy map</h2>
            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">Interviews with users allowed us to emphasize with respondents. We decided to make an empathy map, to keep their views
            in mind, in the further stages of the project.</p>

            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">With interviews and an empathy map, we were able to localize the most common needs that people want to fulfill.</p>
            <div class="image wow fadeInLeft" data-wow-duration="2s">
                <a href="./img/case_study_mapeco/mapeco_needs.png" data-lightbox="needs"><img

            <h2 class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">Generating ideas</h2>
            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">At this stage, we were pretty confident about the problems and challenges that people have with segregation and the
            reduction of waste. It was time to start thinking about how technology can help with them. Firstly, we tried to generate
            as many ideas as we can during brainstorming. Then, we discussed them within our group, and also with other people in
            design thinking class. Finally, we decided to follow four different ideas, to get a better sense of how they could work
            and see how people would react.</p>

            <h4 class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">Mobile game that helps to learn segregation</h4>
            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">This game would look like this: the different kinds of waste would move towards us and we would have to move them to the
            proper basket. It would be a so-called endless game, where we need to go as far as we can, with an increasing difficulty
            level.</p>
            <div class="image wow fadeInLeft" data-wow-duration="2s">

            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">This social app would help to connect with other people caring about the environment. There would be some bits of
            advice, tasks, and events that encourage eco-friendly activities.</p>
            <div class="image wow fadeInLeft" data-wow-duration="2s">

            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">Easy to use app that allows scanning a product and provides information to which segregation basket should it go to. It would also give us ideas about how we can reuse this packaging.</p>

            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">An app that would help users that want to limit waste generation. This app would allow you to search eco shops, local
            markets, cafes that give a discount for bringing your cup, etc.</p>

            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">We made a few interviews, where we asked respondents what they think about presented ideas. We found out, that the most
            interesting idea was an app with eco-friendly locations. This is why we decided to develop that app.</p>

            <h2 class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">Prototype</h2>
            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">With one chosen idea of an app we want to make, we could think over what kind of features it should have. We wanted to
            give users an easy overview of the eco-friendly locations in their neighborhood. They should be able to find places such
            as eco shops, local markets, cafeterias that allow and maybe even give discounts for bringing your favorite cup, places
            where you can hand over or exchange things you don't need, etc. The users should have the choice about the method of
            browsing - via map or a list. There should be also some filter that allows sorting, setting maximum distance, and
            choosing categories. Finally, the users should be able to save their favorite places, give feedback, and add new places
            to the app.</p>
            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">With those features in mind, we created the clickable prototype of an app, that we called MAPeco.</p>

            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">When the first version of the prototype was ready, we have done a few small and unstructured usability tests. We wanted
            to get more general feedback about the interface and localize some major flaws. Those tests allowed us to see how users
            interact with the prototype and what kind of things caused problems. The list of fixes we have done:</p>
            
            <span class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s"><b>Map:</b></span><br>
            <ul class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">

            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">When we fixed the more obvious flaws in our prototype based on the first usability tests, we did these tests again. This
            time they were structured and better think through.</p>
            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">We designed the tasks that would reflect the real usage scenario. For example, we asked about searching the cafe where
            you can bring your own cup, saving the place to the favorites, and adding a comment.</p>
            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">We found out what kind of things were easy and intuitive to users, and what needs some polishing. In a further
            development, we should look into things like marking the localization of a user, change some icons and show the exact
            address after clicking at a place in the map bookmark.</p>

            <h2 class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">Final thoughts</h2>
            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">This project taught me how important it is to research a given problem and not jump to conclusions too quickly.
            Sometimes that problem is a part of a different problem, or we can have a bad sense of what we were trying to solve.</p>
            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">Thanks to interviews I was able to get to know different perspectives and different problems that people have. The
            respondents shared with us many interesting thoughts and hints, that results in the final solution.</p>
            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">fter spending many hours building a prototype we were feeling pretty good about our design. With usability tests, we
            have realized that our design has many flaws, that weren't so obvious to us. Sometimes respondents had problems with
            tasks, that we thought were easy and obvious. The redesign made an app look better, but the usability tests showed us
            some flaws once again. This experience learned me, that designing is an iterative process of prototyping and testing,
            that can go on and on, but with every iteration, we get a better result.</p>
