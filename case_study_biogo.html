                <p>We were given a task to increase the conversion rate at the biogo website. Firstly, we have made a few usability tests
                to locate the most problematic elements. After analyzing the results, we did a competition analysis, with a focus on the
                elements that need some improvements on Biogo. Finally, we have designed a few problematic elements and we proposed the
                plan for further development.</p>

            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">At the start of the project, we were given the following fictional e-mail, from the owner of the Biogo store:</p>
            <div id="email" class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">
                <span>Re: Conversion rate increase</span><br>
                <span>Hello,</span><br>
                <span>My biggest competition is https://minimal.com.pl . They are selling 10-12% more than us. I have to admit that I really like their site.</span><br>
                <span>I am also interested in other websites related to the eco-lifestyle. The following pages seem inspiring to me:</span>

            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">So the problem we were facing was redesigning a website so it would have more customers. Our client wanted to have a
            more minimalistic and intuitive store, as she had seen at the competitors. We were given the websites, that our client
            found interesting, and it gave us a sense of what kind of aesthetic she likes.

            <h2 class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">Usability tests</h2>
            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">We spotted a few flaws right away, but we didn't want to jump to conclusions, so we decided to arrange three usability
            tests. Our respondents were people 20 to 30 years old - the main target of this store. We were able to localize the
            greatest advantages and the elements that need to be improved or rethought.</p>

            <h4 class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">Visuals</h4>
            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">The first thing our respondents noticed was the overall aesthetic of the website. They said that it looks modern and
            distinct from the other stores. The recommended products on the landing page was a good idea, as they got respondents
            attention right away. That's because they were new or in unfamiliar forms.</p>

            </div>

            <h4 class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">Product description</h4>
            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">The product description page gave a good impression. It is clear, contains a lot of information, and allows easy
            navigation to delivery options and product reviews.</p>
            <div class="image wow fadeInLeft video" data-wow-duration="2s">

            </div>

            <h4 class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">"About us" bookmark</h4>
            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">Users also claimed that the "about us" bookmark is interestingly described and gives trust. You get to know the mission
            and commitment of the creators, which makes you want to stay on this site a little longer.</p>
            <div class="image wow fadeInLeft video" data-wow-duration="2s">
                <video controls loop>

            <h4 class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">Contrast</h4>
            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">The color selection makes a good impression at the beginning. But after some time of browsing a store, it becomes tiring
            and hard to read. We found out it was because of the poor contrast of the font and background color. Based on the
            contrast test we made the two main font colors got the 1.9 and 4.42 scores. According to WCAG, the minimum is the ratio
            of 4.1 and the standard should be 7.5. These results were reflected in our empirical test. Almost all of the users told
            us that the use of the website was tiring on the eyes.</p>
            <div class="image wow fadeInLeft side_to_side_photo" data-wow-duration="2s">
                <div>

            <h4 class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">Menu</h4>
            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">An element that seemed to need some adjustments is the layout of the
                categories in the menu tab. After usability tests,
                we realized it needs to be changed completely. The users found it difficult to find a given category, they were
                unsure
                why some categories are on the main bar and the "menu" tab and whether they were the same category. The menu was
                difficult to navigate, as users often closed the tab accidentally, which forced them to navigate more carefully.
                Some of
                the categories are too long, which causes a lot of scrolling.</p>
            <div class="image wow fadeInLeft video" data-wow-duration="2s">

            </div>

            <h4 class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">Filters</h4>
            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">The filters are often used to narrowing given products. The available filters on biogo are quite understandable. Users
            didn't have a problem finding the option they needed, but using them is tedious and discouraging. That is because of a
            few reasons. Every time we select a filter, the whole page refreshes. So selecting a few filters causes refreshing
            several times. Additionally, we don't see selected filters right away. To see if a given filter is selected we need to
            click on that filter. Checking every one of many filters to see which of them are selected is very time-consuming.</p>

            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">On competition analysis, we were looking at the stores that are similar to Biogo. We focused on the elements that Biogo
            didn't handle very well.</p>

            <h4 class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">Minimal</h4>
            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">The first store we decided to analyze was the suggested Minimal store. Their strengths are minimalism and clarity. They
            resigned from more common filters and used tags instead. A lot of design choices were possible due to the selected
            offer, without as many products as Biogo has. The things that Biogo lacks is simplicity and readability.

            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">On this website, we noticed how the menu is made. They have a lot of categories, just like Biogo, but it is better
            thought out and make the navigation much easier.

            <h2 class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">Suggested solutions</h2>
            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">After usability tests and competition analysis, we started to think
                about the solutions. We proposed a few of the
                solutions that could be implemented.</p>
            
            <h4 class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">Contrast</h4>
            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">When dealing with contrast we knew, that chosen color has to be similar to the previous one and be much better readable.
            A good contrast ratio is crucial, as it will give a better visual reception of the portal, and customers will have a
            better overall experience. Our proposition got an 8.7 ratio.

            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">We decided to make the menu clearer and better organized. Now it has
                two main categories - grocery and drugstore. We
                carefully planned the subcategories in order not to make any confusion.

            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">The categories submenu was too long making filters hard to find. We decided to show just the current section, with the
            option to go back to more general sections.</p>
            <div class="image wow fadeInLeft" data-wow-duration="2s">

            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">We made the filters more responsive and readable. It will make browsing the store easier. Simplification of the

            <h2 class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">Final thoughts</h2>
            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">With this project, I learned how the real contacts with a client could look like, and what to expect. We couldn't do
            anything, because we had to meet the client's needs, but we also had to show initiative.</p>
            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">Usability tests helped us to see how the real scenario interaction looks like, and to spot the elements that confuse
            users. We also get feedback on the overall experience.</p>
            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">Benchmarking was an important step, as we saw how the other stores look like before we started redesigning elements. It
            is crucial to design something, that is familiar to the user and easy to navigate, but also has distinct look.</p>
            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">In the last step, we have redesigned some elements based on previous research. We believe that the changes we made,
            would make this website more user-friendly, which would result in higher conversion.</p>
