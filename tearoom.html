                <h2>Overview:</h2>
                <p>In 2018 I started to study Social Informatics and this project was the start of my UX designer journey. There was a lot
                of new knowledge to take in and put into practice. We came across a lot of challenges, but with proper organization and
                determination, we were able to handle them. Our work was exceptionally appreciated by our professors.</p>
                <p>Firstly, we were trying to localize some problems that we are currently struggling with within our society. We put our
                focus on the feeling of loneliness within elderly people. Then we used different methods to find out why younger people
                don't reach so often to their parents or grandparents and we were trying to find a way to connect them.
                <p>One aspect of this problem was the fact, that we often seek help or advice on the internet, usually within our (not
                so experienced) peers. We proposed a platform, that allows sharing the stories and experience by older people, mostly
                with the assistance of younger people, who could handle technical issues and do the interview. We believe that would be
                also an incentive to hear out and spend some time with our parents and grandparents.</p>

            <h2 class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s" >The problem</h2>
            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">Our task was to localize some problems in day-to-day life. We decided to focus on the problem of intergenerational
            relations.</p>
            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">The role of elderlies in our society drastically changed due to technological advancement. A few decades ago, we would
            seek knowledge and advice from older people. But now, we are often looking for that knowledge on the internet, where
            information is often unreliable. We wanted to find a way to encourage people, to look up practical knowledge, based on
            experience, from elderlies once again.</p>

        <section id="next_section">
            <h2 class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">Six hats method</h2>
            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">In the beginning, we decided to use the six thinking hats method. It allowed us to look at this problem from different
            perspectives, but one at a time, so it allowed us to avoid confusion from too many angles crowding our thinking.</p>

            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">Looking at the problem using the six hats method wasn't enough, because we wanted to look from the perspective of different stakeholders. This is when the CATWOE analysis came in handy. That method allowed us to see the impact our         solution could have. At that time we fully understood how important our work is and how the tools we create can affect
            the people around us.</p>
        <h4 class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">Customers</h4>
        <ul class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">
            <li><i>Who is on the receiving end?</i> - The young people</li>
            <li><i>What problem do they have now?</i> - Lack of access to knowledge from the elderlies</li>
            <li><i>How will they react to what you are proposing?</i> - They will wonder about the benefits of using the method proposed by us. But in time they would see the advantage of
            gaining knowledge in that way </li>
            <li><i>Who are the winners and losers?</i> - The winners are younger and older people. The younger will have new space to gain knowledge, the older will be listened

            <li><i>What is the impact on them?</i> - Older people are feeling useless, and younger don't have a reliable source of practical knowledge based on life
            experience</li>

            <li><i>What is the real problem you are working on?</i> - The younger and older people move away from each other, they have less and less contact</li>

                <li>Technological: Limited resources and tools, like automatic transcription</li>
                <li>Social: Younger people are used to their way of seeking knowledge and it can be hard to change these habits</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li><i>What are the ethical limits, laws, financial constraints, limited resources, regulations, and so on?</i> - We need to be careful not to cross the line of privacy</li>
            <li><i>How might these constrain your solution? How can you get around them?</i> - We can make a guideline of what is recommended and what we should not share</li>

            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">After seeing the problem from different perspectives, we decided to have a better look at the customer. We did that to
            ensure that a product is positioned around what the customer values and needs. To do that we used Value Proposition Canvas</p>

            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">Finally, it was time to talk with potential customers. To do that, we designed qualitative interviews. Each member of our group conducted 2 such interviews, so we had 8 subjects in total. We decided to do the interviews with students, and
            to assure this group is diverse, each of them was a student of a different field. To gain more experience, one of the interview was recorded, and at the other, we took notes.</p>
            <h4 class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">Results</h4>
            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">We found out, that older people are still valuable to the young generation. They like to listen to and spend time with
            elderlies. But we don't need pieces of advice from them to start independent lives, because we can find a lot of helpful guides on the internet. So people don't reach out to ask about cleaning or cooking, but they find life lessons particularly helpful. Because they are based on the long-life experience they seem more credible than guidance on the
            internet.</p>

We understood the user's needs, experiences, behaviors, and goals. So it was time to create personas, to have that picture in mind through the rest of the process. We created two personas based on interviews - 19-year-old Matylda and 20-year-old Antoś.</p>

            perspective of a student Antek. They represent two factors that complement each other. Jadzia is happy to share their stories and read how they positively impacted on lives of the people like Antek. Based on those stories we created a storyboard, that visualize both perspectives.</p>

            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">When we were working on this project, we started by localizing a problem, and we end up creating a prototype of the
            platform, that could be implemented and have a real impact.</p>
            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">I learned to look at the big picture of the process of delivering products. I learned also to look up real user
            problems, which I need to fully understand, to create the best possible service.</p>
            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">The work in an involved team showed me, how we can complement each other, despite having weaknesses in some areas.</p>
            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.8s">Finally, I learned and put into practice a lot of useful methods and tools, that I can use in future projects.</p>
